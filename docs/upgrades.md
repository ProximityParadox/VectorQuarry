## Upgrades

Upgrades currently consist of **speed modules** which directly increase the excavation throughput of the quarry. Each upgrade increases energy demand to preserve constant per-block energy efficiency, but this relationship can be redefined via configuration. This ensures both a stable balancing baseline and the flexibility for administrators or modpack developers to redefine economic or progression dynamics.

There are no magical enhancements or ore conjuration modules. All excavation occurs via actual block breaking in-world, preserving Minecraft's core spatial mechanics.
