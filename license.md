# Temporary License Notice

This repository is published for the sole purpose of **code inspection and architectural review**. You are free to read, analyze, and critique the code and documentation in this repository to understand the design intent and system constraints behind **VectorQuarry**.

However:

- **No reuse, redistribution, or derivative work is permitted at this time.**
- **All source code and documentation are All Rights Reserved.**
- **No contributions, pull requests, patches, or forks will be accepted.**
- This includes internal use, porting, partial reuse, or adaptation of any subsystem, structure, or concept in downstream projects.

If you have questions or concerns, contact details are available in `docs\contribution.md`.

This restriction is **temporary**. When the mod reaches a stable and runnable state, the repository will be relicensed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)** or a similarly permissive file-level copyleft license. That license will replace this notice and formally define reuse and contribution terms.

Until then, please treat this repository as **read-only intellectual property**, not as an open-source codebase.

Thank you for respecting these boundaries.
